I am the [Kelly Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Miller_(scientist)) Professor of Mathematics at [Johns Hopkins University](https://mathematics.jhu.edu/) working on higher category theory, homotopy type theory, and computer formalization. I am currently serving as Director of Graduate Studies.

I'm honored to be an invited sectional speaker in topology at the 2026 [International Congress of Mathematicians](https://www.icm2026.org/event/ac193975-5d24-4628-8c30-ddb23de19a8b/speakers). 

I run the  [Johns Hopkins Category Theory Seminar](https://emilyriehl.github.io/seminar/) and am a co-organizer of the [Homotopy Type Theory Electronic Seminar Talks](https://uwo.ca/math/faculty/kapulkin/seminars/hottest.html). I was both an organizer and lecturer for the [HoTTEST Summer School](https://uwo.ca/math/faculty/kapulkin/seminars/hottest_summer_school_2022.html), the archives of which can now be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/martinescardo/HoTTEST-Summer-School) and on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtIZ5qxwSNnzpNqfXzJjlHI9yCAzRzKtx).

I am a co-host of the [n-Category Caf&eacute;](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/) and was a founding board member of [Spectra](http://lgbtmath.org/), where I now serve on the Board of Trustees. <img src="https://emilyriehl.github.io/files/progress-pride.webp" width = "5%"/>

I am currently a member of the [Executive Committee of the AMS Council](https://www.ams.org/about-us/governance/exec-comm/ec) and serve in that capacity on a number of other AMS committees.

I am a member of the Strategic Advisory Board for the [Mathlib Initiative](https://mathlib-initiative.org/), the Scientific Advisory Board for the [Institute for Computer-Aided Reasoning in Mathematics](https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2025/august/new-nsf-institute-at-cmu-will-help-mathematicians-harness-ai-and-advance-discoveries), and the Scientific Review Panel for the [Pacific Institute for Mathematical Sciences](https://pims.math.ca/).

I serve on the editorial boards for [Homology, Homotopy, and Applications](https://www.intlpress.com/index.php), the [Bulletin of the AMS](https://www.ams.org/publications/journals/journalsframework/bull), and [Zeitschrift f√ºr Mathematische Logik und Grundlagen der Mathematik](https://zml.international/). In the past, I have served as an editor at [Cahiers de Topologie et G&eacute;om&eacute;trie Diff&eacute;rentielle Cat&eacute;goriques](http://cahierstgdc.com/), [Journal of Homotopy and Related Structures](https://www.springer.com/journal/40062), the [Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-pure-and-applied-algebra/editorial-board), and [Mathematical Logic Quarterly](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15213870).

There is a fairly large cohort of PhD students at Johns Hopkins who are interested in category theory, abstract homotopy theory, homotopy type theory, and related topics.
