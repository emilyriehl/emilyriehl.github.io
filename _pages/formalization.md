* A project to formalize synthetic &infin;-category theory in the simplicial type theory introduced in [joint work](https://emilyriehl.github.io/files/synthetic.pdf) with [Mike Shulman](https://home.sandiego.edu/~shulman/) is ongoing. Formalizations have been contributed by [Nikolai Kudasov](https://fizruk.github.io/), [Jonathan Weinberger](https://sites.google.com/view/jonathanweinbergers), and myself, using the computer proof assistant [Rzk](https://github.com/fizruk/rzk) developed by Nikolai. Our preliminary goal, to formalize the &infin;-categorical Yoneda lemma, can be found on [github](https://github.com/emilyriehl/yoneda) and on the [web](https://emilyriehl.github.io/yoneda/). The repository also hosts a comparative formalization of the 1-categorical Yoneda lemma in Lean written by [Sina Hazratpour](https://sinhp.github.io/). Further developments in simplicial homotopy theory appear in a repository dedicated to [simplicial homotopy type theory](https://github.com/fizruk/sHoTT/) which has had many contributions.

* A project to formalize formal &infin;-category theory in Lean has just launched. A [blueprint](https://emilyriehl.github.io/infinity-cosmos/) set up for me by [Pietro Monticone](https://github.com/pitmonticone) describes our broader objectives and initial formalization targets. This project is co-lead by [Dominic Verity](https://dom-verity.github.io/) and [Mario Carneiro](https://digama0.github.io/) who collaborated with me on the surprisingly intricate task to construct the right adjoint to the nerve functor, resulting in some code which is on its way into Mathlib and can be found [here](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/tree/CatHasColimits).

* In Fall 2021, I taught a graduate topics course on homotopy type theory, following [Egbert Rijke's](https://github.com/EgbertRijke) wonderful [Introduction to Homotopy Type Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11082). For this course, I wrote 10 Agda problem sets and prepared a short agda tutorial. All of the course materials can be found on the [course website](https://github.com/emilyriehl/721).
