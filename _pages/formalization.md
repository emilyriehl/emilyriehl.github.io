* A project to formalize synthetic &infin;-category theory in the simplicial type theory introduced in [joint work](https://emilyriehl.github.io/files/synthetic.pdf) with [Mike Shulman](https://home.sandiego.edu/~shulman/) is ongoing. Formalizations have been contributed by [Nikolai Kudasov](https://fizruk.github.io/), [Jonathan Weinberger](https://sites.google.com/view/jonathanweinbergers), and myself, using the computer proof assistant [rzk](https://github.com/fizruk/rzk) developed by Nikolai. Our preliminary goal, to formalize the &infin;-categorical Yoneda lemma, can be found on [github](https://github.com/emilyriehl/yoneda) and on the [web](https://emilyriehl.github.io/yoneda/). The repository also hosts a comparative formalization of the 1-categorical Yoneda lemma in Lean written by [Sina Hazratpour](https://sinhp.github.io/). Further developments in simplicial homotopy theory will in a repository dedicated to [simplicial homotopy type theory](https://github.com/fizruk/sHoTT/).

* In Fall 2021, I taught a graduate topics course on homotopy type theory, following [Egbert Rijke's](https://github.com/EgbertRijke) wonderful [Introduction to Homotopy Type Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11082). For this course, I wrote 10 agda problem sets and prepared a short agda tutorial. All of the course materials can be found on the [course website](https://github.com/emilyriehl/721).
