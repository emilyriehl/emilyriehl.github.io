## Edited Volume

In Fall 2019, I hosted a weekend workshop entitled [A conversation on professional norms in mathematics](https://math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/norms/) with the generous support of the National Science Foundation CAREER Grants Program and the Department of Mathematics at Johns Hopkins University.

Following that event, [Mathilde Gerbelli-Gauthier](https://mgerbelli.github.io/website/), [Pamela E. Harris](https://www.pamelaeharris.com/), 
[Michael A. Hill](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~mikehill/), 
[Dagan Karp](https://www.math.hmc.edu/~dk/), and I produced an edited volume, published by the [American Mathematical Society](https://bookstore.ams.org/mbk-140).

Thanks to a special arrangement from the publisher, the text of the manuscript is now available here:

* [A Conversation on Professional Norms in Mathematics](https://emilyriehl.github.io/files/norms.pdf)
