Title: Codescent objects and lax coherence

Abstract: A 2-categorical colimit called a codescent object has several applications in 2-dimensional algebra &mdash; for instance in the proof of Steve Lack's Coherence theorem and in a statement of a 2-dimensional analogue of Beck's monadicity theorem. I will go through ways to compute various codescent objects and also give exposition on a lesser known version of Steve Lack's Coherence theorem for lax algebras. The talk will feature numerous examples.

Title: [On the &infin;-topos semantics of homotopy type theory I](https://emilyriehl.github.io/files/semantics.pdf)

Abstract: In Fall 2021 I taught a semester-long graduate topics course in homotopy type theory without telling the class what any of it means. What I mean by this is we neglected entirely to discuss the <i>semantics</i> of homotopy type theory in traditional set-based mathematics. In the first part of a two part series, I plan to sketch the construction, due to Voevodsky, that interprets theorems in homotopy type theory as theorems about simplicial sets. In the second part, I'll then sketch the proof due to Shulman et al that extends this result to an arbitrary &infin;-topos.

Title: Making internal logics to order with geometric definability 

Abstract:  We've seen how homotopy type theory can be interpreted in any &infin;-topos. But what if we have a specific &infin;-topos E in mind. What axioms can we add to HoTT to make it so that we are working in E specifically (or a suitably similar topos)?

In this talk, we'll answer this question for 1-toposes using a theorem due to Ingo Blechschmidt: <i>geometric definability</i>. Geometric definability gives a unification between syntax and semantics in the internal logic that we can use to give practical axioms for working in the internal logic of any topos. Along the way, we will learn about the yoga of geometric logic and classifying toposes.

Time permitting, I'll put forward a speculative conjecture which I'll call <i>geometric constructability</i>, which would extend this method for working in the internal logic to &infin;-toposes and homotopy type theory. This opens up the possibility of a type theory which would let us work in all toposes over a given base topos simultaneously, moving between them via geometric morphisms.

Title: Sheaves of t-categories

Abstract: The notion of a t-category, or a triangulated category equipped with a t-structure, was introduced by Beilinson, Bernstein, and Deligne in their study of perverse sheaves. To avoid certain pathologies inherent in the category of triangulated categories, it is more convenient to upgrade this notion to that of a stable infinity-category equipped with a t-structure. Since the infinity-category of stable infinity-categories admits limits, this allows us to consider sheaves of t-categories. A main example is the derived infinity-category of a scheme. We will begin with a quick introduction to stable infinity-categories and t-structures, attempt to motivate why one might be interested in such things, and conclude with some more recent results on existence of bounded t-structures and applications to algebraic K-theory.

Title: Toposic view on deep neural networks

Abstract: First of all this lecture will be an attempt to understand and to learn from the article [Topos and stacks of deep neural networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.14587.pdf) of J.C.Belfiore and D.Bennequin. All the original research work is due to them. Deep Neural Networks are very useful in machine learning and thus have many modern applications. After recalling some basic facts about those networks, I will expose the approach of Belfiore and Bennequin consists in associating a topos to a Deep Neural Network and then interpret some features of it (which are useful for machine learning perspective such as learning dynamics, invariant structures in the layers, semantical functioning, ...) in the topos associated to the Deep Neural Network. One could hope with such an interpretation, one could in the long term understand better the network or design better networks by listening to the suggestions of the topos.

Title: Homotopy theory of Virtual Double Simplicial Sets

Abstract: The first part of the talk will be a review of virtual double categories (vdcs), the co-Yoneda lemma, and generalized T-multicategories. I will work with the examples Span(C), and V-prof for vdcs and detail the formal construction of a vdc as a fc-multicategory. If we remove the assumption of pullback in C, or we allow for varying V in &ldquo;V-prof&rdquo;, we are forced us to compose weakly. This warrants a simplicial version of a virtual double category.

The second part is under construction, so will act as more of a discussion after tea. I will talk about the development of a homotopy theory of virtual double simplicial sets (vdsSets). This development involves defining a notion of representability that will allows us to define (1) coskeletal induction, (2) horn conditions and (3) slice categories. (1) constructs examples of vdsSets (2) defines virtual double oo-categories and (3) defines op/cartesian cells. These are all important for understanding the vdsSet &ldquo;Ont&rdquo; whose objects are (object:category) pairs c:C, d:D, and whose pro-morphisms are comma objects F(c)-f->G(d):M, and for describing a yoneda lemma in Ont. Ont is a toy model for a meta-theory of ontology.

Title: The &eacute;tale fibration over topoi

Abstract: The purpose of the talk is to show how ideas of dependent type theory (dependent sums and dependent products) can be used to revisit features of topology (locally contractible and compact spaces). The theory of &infin;-topoi is based on the universe of &infin;-groupoids (of the universe of sets in the 1-categorical setting). This universe is encoded by the fibration of Ã©tale maps over the category of &infin;-topoi. We shall see that this universe has dependent sums, but not dependent products. We shall then see that the morphisms of topoi along which this universe has dependent sums are the locally contractible morphisms, and the morphisms along which dependent products exists are proper morphisms. This is jww Jonathan Weinberger.

Title: A 2-Categorical Proof of Frobenius in HoTT 

Abstract: In the context of models of HoTT, the Frobenius condition says that the pushforward along fibrations preserve fibrations. This is used for the interpretation of dependent product (&Pi;) types. Coquand gave a simple constructive proof of Frobenius in Cubical Type Theory, taking advantage of the fact that fibration structures can be reduced to composition structures. We give a 2-categorical proof of the Frobenius condition guided by the category-theoretic proofs by Gambino & Sattler and by Awodey. This is based on joint work with Emily Riehl.

Title: The Objective Metatheory of Simply Typed Lambda Calculus

Abstract: Normalisation by evaluation was initially discovered by accident, with the idea of leveraging a Lisp interpreter for reducing lambda calculus terms. Since this discovery, it was clear that NbE had some underlying categorical content, and, in 1995, Altenkirch et al published the first categorical normalisation proof. Discovering this content requires first asking the question &ldquo;What is STLC?&rdquo;, perhaps preceded by the question &ldquo;What is a type theory?&rdquo;. Clarifying these notions yields the concept of evaluation, and, from there, one can inductively construct normalisation proofs by assembling proof objects in an appropriately structured category. This talk will lay out all of these ideas with care, following along our recent formalisation of Altenkirch's proof in Cubical Agda. As a bonus, a modification of our formalisation employing setoids of computational traces yields the implementation of a NbE powered stepper (Stepping by Evaluation).

Title: A tale of two model structures

Abstract: In this talk I will present joint work with Lyne Moser and Maru Sarazola, in which we construct two model structures on the category of double categories. The novel feature of these with respect to existent ones in the literature is that both of our model structures &ldquo;contain&rdquo; the homotopy theory of  2-categories. Moreover, they induce Lack's model structure on 2-categories via different versions of the horizontal embedding of 2-categories into double categories. We will introduce these two model structures, discuss their main properties, and show how they relate to each other.

 Title: Formally adjoining duals to symmetric monoidal (&infin;-)categories

Abstract: I will review the familiar notion of <i>dual objects</i> in a symmetric monoidal category C. I will then consider the less-familiar construction which freely adjoins duals to the objects of C to obtain a new symmetric monoidal category D(C) in which every object is dualizable. In order for this construction to be well-defined, it is convenient to work in an &infin;-categorical setting (but, as I hope to convey, the essential ideas I will discuss are generally motivated from basic 1-categorical considerations). I will discuss some results from my thesis concerning the functor D and some close variants thereof where care is taken to respect additional structure on C such as certain colimits. In addition to several abstract motivations for considering such constructions, I will discuss an application, giving a new universal property for genuine equivariant stable homotopy theory in terms of equivariant Spanier-Whitehead duality.

 Title: Classifying spaces of categories of structures
 
Abstract: Probably the most common two categories whose objects are used to model homotopy types are topological spaces and simplicial sets (or variations on these). I will survey a few alternatives to these, including other presheaf categories, and most fundamentally, the category Cat of (small) categories itself. Here a category is identified with the homotopy type of its classifying space. Much of this theory is systematized in the theory of <i>localizers</i> laid out by Grothendieck, and studied by Thomason, Maltsiniotis, Cisinski, and others.<br>

As we will see, every homotopy type is modeled by some category. In the second half of the talk, I will turn to the perplexing fact that nevertheless, most <i>naturally occurring</i> categories are weakly contractible. This raises a challenge: given an interesting homotopy type X, find an interesting category C with that homotopy type. I will discuss joint work with Jinhe Ye and Gregory Cousins addressing one version of this question, with applications to logic (and specifically to model theory).

 Title: Kripke-Joyal Semantics for Dependent Type Theory
 
 Abstract: Every topos has an internal higher-order intuitionistic logic. In the first part of my talk I will give an expository account of this internal logic. I will also overview the so-called KripkeâJoyal semantics of a topos which has proved to be a powerful technique in topos theory. In its most basic formulation, Kripke-Joyal semantics provides a way to test the validity a formula of the internal logic of a topos.

In the second part of my talk, I will explain how to replace the internal logic of a topos by a more expressive internal type theory. I will also introduce a generlization of Kripke-Joyal semantics which provides a convenient way of moving back and forth between the internal type theory and the diagrams in a topos. 
This talk is based on a joint work with Steve Awodey and Nicola Gambino.

 Title: Kripke-Joyal Semantics for Homotopy Type Theory
 
 Abstract: We will use the Kripke-Joyal Semantics of the internal dependent type theory of presheaf toposes to work with various algebraic structures in presheaf toposes. I shall demonstrate how our extended Kripke-Joyal Semantics can be used to relate some of the recent type-theoretic and category-theoretic developments in finding constructive models of Homotopy Type Theory.

This talk is based on a joint work with Steve Awodey and Nicola Gambino.

Title: Double categories and algebraic <i>K</i>-theory
 
Abstract: Algebraic K-theory is a subject that touches upon a variety of fields, techniques, and applications. Starting with the work of Grothendieck in 1957, it was quickly taken up by Bass and Milnor, who defined the lower K-groups of a ring, and bloomed under Quillen&mdash;and later, Waldhausen&mdash;who introduced the rich higher invariants we know today. At its heart, it consists of a machinery that takes some flavor of algebraic structure as input, and produces a space, or a spectrum, whose homotopical structure records key data about the original object.

This talk hopes to be an introduction to algebraic K-theory from a category theorist's point of view. After briefly talking about the historical motivation, we will delve into some of the different types of categories that a classical algebraic K-theory machinery may take as an input, and how (bi)simplicial sets are constructed from these categories to obtain their K-theory spaces. We will also talk about how K-theory is &ldquo;universally additive&rdquo; in some precise sense, and mention other classical foundational results along the way.

No previous background of K-theory required!

 Title: Double categories and algebraic <i>K</i>-theory
 
 Abstract: In recent work, Campbell and Zakharevich introduced a new type of structure, called ACGW-category. These are double categories satisfying a list of axioms that seek to extract the properties of abelian categories which make them so particularly well-suited for algebraic K-theory. The main appeal of these double categories is that they generalize the structure of exact sequences in abelian categories to non-additive settings such as finite sets and reduced schemes, thus showing how finite sets and schemes behave like the objects of an abelian category for the purpose of algebraic K-theory.
 
 In this talk, we will explore the key features of ACGW categories and the intuition behind them. Then, we will move on to recent work with Brandon Shapiro where we further develop this program by defining &ldquo;ACGW categories with weak equivalences&rdquo;, which allow us to get a notion of chain complexes and quasi-isomorphisms for finite sets. These satisfy an analogue of the classical GilletâWaldhausen Theorem, providing an alternate model for the K-theory of finite sets.

 Title: S-algebras and the Field with One Element
 
 Abstract: Absolute geometry, or geometry over the oxymoronic &ldquo;field with one element&rdquo; F1, seeks to extend the classical algebraic geometry of rings so that arithmetic schemes (such as Spec Z) can be treated on a similar footing to schemes defined over fields. The program's loftiest ambitions include proving the Riemann hypothesis, whose analogue over finite fields has been known since Deligne in the 1970s. Since the initial conjecture of F1-geometry by Smirnov and Manin in the late 1980's and early 1990's, numerous different objects have been proposed as foundations for it, from monoids and semirings to more exotic objects like hyperrings, blueprints, and Lambda-rings.
 
 In this talk, we will briefly go over the motivations for F1-geometry and a few notable past attempts at constructing it. Then, for the bulk of the talk, we will focus on Alain Connes and Katia Consani's recent attempts to construct an absolute geometry over the category of Gamma-sets. We will lay out the main features of Connes and Consani's project so far, which include proposals for a compactified scheme Spec Z-bar, the spectrum of a general S-algebra, and an analogue of singular cohomology with coefficients in a Gamma-space; as well as discussing its connections with other versions of absolute geometry. Finally, we will note what questions about this geometry over S remain open.
 
 Primary references for this talk are Connes and Consani's papers &ldquo;Absolute algebra and Segal's Gamma-rings: Au dessous de Spec Z-bar,&rdquo; &ldquo;On Absolute Algebraic Geometry: The Affine Case,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Spec Z-bar and the Gromov Norm,&rdquo; along with their sequels; the speaker may also reference his own recent scribblings based on these papers. Descriptions of the classical setup are largely based on Hartshorne's <i>Algebraic Geometry</i> (Sec. I.6, IV.1) and Dino Lorenzini's <i>Invitation to Arithmetic Geometry</i> (Ch. 8-10), and background on F1-geometry is primarily drawn from Oliver Lorscheid's overview &ldquo;F1 for everyone,&rdquo; together with the papers it references for specific constructions.

 Title: An example in cohesive topos theory
 
 Abstract: I will try to explain parts of Urs Schrieberâs work on [cohesive topos](https://ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/differential+cohomology+in+a+cohesive+topos), in particular, the example of smooth Deligne complex.

 Title: An introduction to A1-homotopy theory
 
 Abstract: There are intricate links between algebraic varieties and 
 topological spaces. For instance algebraic varieties over the real or 
 complex numbers give rise to topological spaces, so with that in mind, 
 how much of homotopy theory can be developed for algebraic varieties or 
 schemes? A1-homotopy theory is one approach which &ldquo;uses the affine line 
 as a substitute for the unit interval in topology&rdquo;. The rigidity of 
 algebra (only polynomial functions are allowed!) makes it unclear how 
 exactly to set up the theory correctly, so I will attempt to give a 
 motivated introduction to how one proceeds. I will not assume the 
 audience is familiar with schemes or algebraic varieties, and instead 
 will give a user-friendly crash course for anything we need. See you there!

 Title: In Homotopy Type Theory, the moduli stack of somethings is the type of those things
 
Abstract: The title is already the abstract, but in particular: Iâll introduce homotopy type theory, a logical framework which, on the one hand:
    - is all about the idea that every mathematical object is a certain <i>type</i> of mathematical objects, and what it means to identify two objects is determined by what type of thing they are;
and, somehow also, 
    - is a way of working directly with higher stacks (sheaves of infinity-groupoids) as if they were defined by what elements they have, just like sets are.
After that single sentence, weâll look at the moduli stack of elliptic curves over C as a type, and compute its homotopy type.

 Title: stable category theory(??) and absolute algebra(???)
 
 Abstract: I will explain how to make sense of &ldquo;(&omega;-)categories with negative dimensional cells,&rdquo; which categorifies &ldquo;spaces with negative dimensional cells,&rdquo; aka spectra, following chapter 13 of German Stefanichâs thesis. After that, time/preparation/my math ability/vibe permitting, Iâll explain how this might potentiall relates to the idea of absolute algebras (in the sense Sean explained in a previous talk).

 Title: Schur Functors and Categorified Plethysm
 
 Abstract: It is known that the Grothendieck group of the category of Schur functors is the ring of symmetric functions. This ring has a rich structure, much of which is encapsulated in the fact that it is a &ldquo;plethory&rdquo;: a monoid in the category of birings with its substitution monoidal structure. We show that similarly the category of Schur functors is a &ldquo;2-plethory&rdquo;, which descends to give the plethory structure on symmetric functions. Thus, much of the structure of symmetric functions exists at a higher level in the category of Schur functors.
